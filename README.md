# newsAnalyzer

This is a simple news analyzer that can be used to pull and analyze google news stories based on user defined terms.  It then runs those articles through an LLM to determine if it meets the context the user was looking for, and then returns those articles as JSON objects.

## Installation

 Needs python versions of:
 - Ollama
 - gnews
 - newspaper3k
 - googlenewsdecoder
 - geopy
 - yaml

## Customization

Modify the [context.yaml](./configs/context.yaml) file to change the search terms and context you want the system to search for.
